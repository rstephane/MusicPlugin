# Tarabia Distortion Plug in

## Description
Tarabia Distortion is a â€¦ distortion plug in effect based on two specials algortihms :
- Tarabia formula (Hard distortion), and,
- Yamaha 80â€™s synth soft distortion formula.

If you have a bass or synth sounds that lacks of body or lack of characterâ€¦ use this plug ins & you will produce a new sound full of harmonics, body & densityâ€¦

If you want to empower the body of your Kicks, Snares or Bass soundsâ€¦ use it !

You donâ€™t need to push the plug in at 100 % to get nice results ðŸ™‚

Last but not leastâ€¦

- It works only on MAC (VST and Audio Unit Format)
- No documentation required ðŸ™‚ very very intuitive user interface !

## Installation
