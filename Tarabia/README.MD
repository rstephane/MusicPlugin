# Tarabia Distortion Plug in

## Description
Tarabia Distortion is a â€¦ distortion plug in effect based on two specials algortihms :
- Tarabia formula (Hard distortion), and,
- Yamaha 80â€™s synth soft distortion formula.

If you have a bass or synth sounds that lacks of body or lack of characterâ€¦ use this plug ins & you will produce a new sound full of harmonics, body & densityâ€¦

If you want to empower the body of your Kicks, Snares or Bass soundsâ€¦ use it !

Last but not leastâ€¦
- It works only on MAC (VST and Audio Unit Format)
- No documentation required ðŸ™‚ very very intuitive user interface !

## Installation
- You can try to compile it yourself ('free' as in free beer),
or,
- if you don't have time neither the competencies, no worries, you can download the binary file ('not free' as in free beer) from the smaolab website: http://smaolab.org/product/tarabia-distortion/

But if you are still there, I may guess that you want to compile it yourself, okay let's go...

### Pre requisite
- The Tarabia Plug in is made from the excellent, simple, efficient framework called DPLUG: Dplug is a framework based on the D langage sort of C and C++ langage. This framework has been made to easily develop your own VST/AU plug ins.

I think D langage (and Dplug) is easier than C++... simpler than Juce and .. many other langages when you try to create your own VST/AU plug ins :)

On top of that DPlug is Free... you can build and sell your own plugins based on this framework.

In order to compile this program, you will need thus :

### Get Started
- You will need to install the Dplug framework (and so the D lagage and compiler). You will find all the steps instructions here : https://github.com/AuburnSounds/Dplug/wiki/Getting-Started  
- Please follow precisely all the instructions ! hein ! Really, I insist follow the instructions >>> From time to time, you will need to add a PATH in your .BASH profile.. etc. Please do not forget to do it :)
- once you have installed DPLUG (which means to installed the SDK VST Lib vrom Steinberg, the D langage compiler, Dub compiler, etc.). Again don't worry >>> if you follow the installation instructions, you will be safe !

### Compile
- Once you have installed the Dplug framework (and the ot), you will get a folder that contains
- to be completed...
