# Tarabia Distortion Plug in

## Description
Tarabia Distortion is a … distortion plug in effect based on two specials algorithms :
- Tarabia formula (Hard distortion), and,
- Yamaha 80’s synth soft distortion formula.

If you have a bass or synth sounds that lacks of body or lack of character… use this plug ins & you will produce a new sound full of harmonics, body & density…

## Installation
- You can try to compile it yourself ('free' as in free beer),
or,
- if you don't have time neither the competencies, no worries, you can download the binary file ('not free' as in free beer) from the smaolab website: http://smaolab.org/product/tarabia-distortion/

But if you are still here, I may guess that you want to compile it yourself, okay let's go...

Lat but not least, all the following instructions has been tested on a MAC. I don't operate under Windows but I know that it is easy to compile Dplug codes under Windows.

### Pre requisite
- The Tarabia Plug in is made from the excellent, simple, efficient framework DPLUG: Dplug is a framework based on the D langage (sort of C and C++ langage). This framework has been created to easily develop VST/AU plug ins.

I think D langage is easier than C++ and I beleive that Dplug is simpler than Juce framework (and less costly). I also beleive the Dplug is easier to use compared to many other langages while trying to create your own VST/AU plug-in and sell it :)

Note that Dplug framework is free as in free beer... you can build & sell your own plugins based on this framework without paying any fees.

### Get Started
In order to compile this program, you will need :
- Install the Dplug framework. You will find all the steps instructions here : https://github.com/AuburnSounds/Dplug/wiki/Getting-Started  
- Please follow precisely all the instructions ! hein ! really, I insist : follow the instructions !
- Once you have installed DPLUG, you can pass to the next paragraph :)

### Compile
- Once you have installed the Dplug framework, you will get a folder that contains several subfolders...
- One of them is called 'examples'.
- Copy the 'tarabia' folder (the folder you have here, my code!) into the 'examples' subfolder.
- Open a terminal window.
- Go to the subfolder 'examples/tarabia/'. I guess you should do a 'cd /users/something/something/...'.
- Launch the command 'dplug-build --compiler ldc'.
- You can also use 'dplug-build --compiler ldc --force' to force the compilation from scratch (meaning that it removes all libs and recompile them).
- Note that you will need an internet connexion when you compile the code. Indeed, Dub (the compiler) will require to fetch some external librairies. It needs thus an internet connexion the first time, it will after caches the libs.

You should get the following output :

```
info: Missing "userManualPath" in plugin.json (eg: "UserManual.pdf")
info: Missing "licensePath" in plugin.json (eg: "license.txt")
info: Missing "iconPath" in plugin.json (eg: "gfx/myIcon.png")

=> The task is to bundle plugin Tarabia Distortion from SMAOLAB.
   This plugin will be working in 64-bit.
   The choosen configurations are ["VST", "AU"].
   The choosen build type is debug.
   The choosen compiler is LDC.

```

- Now, you should go to the subfolder 'examples/tarabia/builds'.. you will find there the VST and Audio unit Compilation results ! You are done !
- Copy the VST (and/or the Audio unit file) into your VST folder and launch your favorite DAW...
- Enjoy .. heu nope .. Destroy (Tarabia is a distortion plug in :) )
